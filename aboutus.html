            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Obehi, and welcome to <strong> ObsssBakesCakes. </strong> </p>
            <p>Welcome to my cake-filled world! I’m Obehi, the baker behind ObsssBakesCakes, where I’m excited to share my sweet journey of creating cakes, cupcakes, and more. From delicate hand-piped flowers to geeky tech-themed cakes, I’m constantly experimenting with new ideas and flavors in the kitchen.</p>

            <p>Baking has been a rewarding adventure, and while I’ve made some delicious masterpieces—like my incredibly moist carrot cake and striking red velvet cake with a motherboard theme—it hasn’t always been smooth sailing. There have been plenty of hiccups along the way (Cricut sticker-making, anyone?). But, we’re all human here, and those baking fails have only made me better.</p>
                
            <p>This is more than just a place for cake photos; it’s a real, behind-the-scenes look at my baking successes and my missteps. Join me as I explore new techniques, share my favorite recipes, and embrace the learning process, one cake at a time.</p>
